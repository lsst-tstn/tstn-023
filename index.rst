   When deploying the Telescope and Site systems for the main telescope at NCSA we started to experience severe startup slow downs. These occurrences affected components both using SalObj and SAL (e.g. CCCamera) and manifested mainly by timeout's in getting historical data followed by the communication being seriously unstable.

With the deployment of a new cycle (with xml 6.1) we decided to take a more close look at the problem. This tech-note describes the findings, proposed solutions and points of concern for the future deployment.
